<h1>The Best Movies According to Ezgi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince</h3>
<p>Really good movie that everyone should watch all series.</p>
<h3>Lucy</h3>
<p>
    I know that it is a sci-fi movie but seeing the brain that can do anything gets me every time. <br/>
    I feel like I have power that I can do everything that I want.

<h3>Red</h3>
<p>
    It is an animation movie. It may seem like it is childish but no sir it is not. <br/>
    I am the girl who is shown about making decisions while trying to not make her parents upset.
